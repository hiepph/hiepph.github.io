Out of the blue, I just want to start blogging. Just like the moment Haruki
Murakami came up with the thought of writing a novel:

> In that instant, for no reason and on no grounds whatsoever, the thought

From now on, this will be my cosy home where I flush my thought and share little
moments in life.  Future is unknown, but for now, from a perspective of
technology and language lover, I'll share my fun projects and also my learning
experience.

I'm looking forward to an interesting journey ahead.
