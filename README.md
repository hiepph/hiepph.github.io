## What's in new edition?

Back in 2017, my old site was generated by Hugo and deployed with external TravisCI.

2021 version uses the new shiny Github Action and the supported
[module](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) for deployment.


## Domains

My blog is reachable via https://hiepph.github.io or https://hiepph.xyz.

I registered my domain `hiepph.xyz` on [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). All traffic to `hiepph.xyz` will first reach Github Pages' IP (via `A`/`AAAA` records), be automatically redirected to `www.hiepph.xyz`, and then finally be routed to `hiepph.github.io` (via `CNAME` record).

The configuration for the Github Pages with custom domain can be referred [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
